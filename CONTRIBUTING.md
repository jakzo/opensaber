Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Contributions are welcome -- feel free to open a PR for small fixes or open an issue for bigger changes, discussion or if unsure about how to implement something.

## Dev Instructions

Before starting, install dependencies with:

```sh
yarn
```

Common commands are:

```sh
yarn test:watch
yarn lint:fix
```

See [package.json](./package.json) for more.

## Releasing changes

Run `yarn workspace [PACKAGE_NAME] version [BUMP_TYPE]` where `[PACKAGE_NAME]` is the name of the package you want to release when merging the PR and `[BUMP_TYPE]` is either `patch`, `minor` or `major` depending on the severity of the change. Commit the file which is created as a result of this command.
